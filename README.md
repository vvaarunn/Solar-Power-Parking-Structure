# Solar-Power-Parking-Structure
This project, aimed to build a solar-powered parking structure to reduce the universityâ€™s carbon footprint, cut energy costs, and provide shaded parking for students and faculty. This repository showcases the data tracking and analysis aspect, focusing on ETL processes and Power BI reporting to monitor energy savings and usage.
Project Overview
The Solar Power Parking Structure at Lot H is designed to support sustainable energy by generating approximately 4,560 kW of solar power. This project required managing several phases, including design, construction, and energy tracking through data-driven insights.

**Key Features:**
ETL Processes: Established ETL pipelines to collect, transform, and load data on solar energy production, energy consumption, and savings. Data preprocessing ensures accuracy for analysis and reporting.
Power BI Dashboard: Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize energy generation, usage patterns, and cost savings. Interactive charts, DAX calculations, and custom tables provide end-users with actionable insights.
Project Impact: Enabled Cal State East Bay to track real-time energy usage and optimize solar energy efficiency, leading to a measurable reduction in energy costs and environmental benefits.

**Project Phases:**
Preliminary Planning: Defined project objectives, estimated budget, and obtained necessary permits.
Design & Engineering: Designed the solar panel system and charging stations, ensuring compliance with local codes.
Procurement: Acquired materials, including solar panels and batteries, navigating supply chain challenges.
Construction: Built the parking structure and installed the solar panels and electrical systems.
Testing & Commissioning: Conducted performance tests and quality assurance to ensure functionality.
Operations & Maintenance: Established ongoing monitoring and maintenance plans for sustained performance.

**Tools & Technologies:**
ETL: Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
Data Visualization: Power BI (DAX measures, Power Query Editor).
Other Resources: SQL for data management, Excel for initial data processing.

**Results**
Environmental Benefits: Reduction in carbon emissions by utilizing renewable energy.
Financial Savings: Decreased energy costs with government incentives.
Enhanced Campus Life: Provided shaded parking to improve campus experience.
